# Dealing with Large Numbers even beyond the range of long long int
---     
### Objective:  Learn to deal with char strings

#### Problem Statement
* Adding two numbers is trivial. In C/C++, the simple mathematical expression such as sum = a + b will add variable 'a' and 'b' and put the result in the variable 'sum'. Your task is to add two very large numbers which are beyond the capacity to be stored in any existing integer data types in C/C++ like long int, etc . Write a function largeAdd(ni,n2) to achieve such very large digit additions. You should save your output (sum) in a text file “sum.txt”.
